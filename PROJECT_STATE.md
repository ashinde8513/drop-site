# PROJECT STATE — drop-landing (read me first)

Last updated: 2026-06-25
Full history (if archived): vault → AI Agents/Codebase Docs/drop-landing/PROJECT_HISTORY.md

## SESSION LOCK
**Status:** UNLOCKED
How to use: advisory + durable record only. Concurrent sessions auto-isolate in their own git worktree (session/<id>) via dev-session.zsh — there is NO global LOCKED state to set. Record Owner / Working on at session start.
### Active session (if any)
- Owner: — · Started: — · Working on: fresh — no sessions yet

## Current status
### What works
- Landing site live at trydropapp.com; link-in-bio hub at trydropapp.com/link; FTC disclosures live.
### In progress — Active Claims
Live cross-session claims (who is working on what right now) are in the vault: `AI Agents/Operations/SESSION_CLAIMS.md` — run `python3 ~/Developer/agent-stack/scripts/session_claim.py list`. List durable in-progress items here.
### Blocked / waiting on
- 
### Exact next step
- BACKLOG.md "Now": add a link-hub-specific `og-image.png` for `/link` (link.html) — it currently reuses the homepage OG image (sitemap submission to Search Console/Bing is also "Now" but needs founder site-verification first).
