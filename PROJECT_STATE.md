# PROJECT STATE — drop-landing (read me first)

Last updated: 2026-06-25
Full history (if archived): vault → AI Agents/Codebase Docs/drop-landing/PROJECT_HISTORY.md

## SESSION LOCK
**Status:** UNLOCKED
How to use: advisory + durable record only. Concurrent sessions auto-isolate in their own git worktree (session/<id>) via dev-session.zsh — there is NO global LOCKED state to set. Record Owner / Working on at session start.
### Active session (if any)
- Owner: — · Started: — · Working on: fresh — no sessions yet

## Current status
### What works
- Landing site live at trydropapp.com; link-in-bio hub at trydropapp.com/link; FTC disclosures live.
### In progress — Active Claims
Live cross-session claims (who is working on what right now) are in the vault: `AI Agents/Operations/SESSION_CLAIMS.md` — run `python3 ~/Developer/agent-stack/scripts/session_claim.py list`. List durable in-progress items here.
### Blocked / waiting on
- Sitemap submission to Google Search Console/Bing Webmaster Tools — needs founder site-verification.
### Exact next step
- BACKLOG.md "Next": add `FAQPage` JSON-LD schema once an on-site FAQ section exists (or build the FAQ section first — see BACKLOG.md Next).
