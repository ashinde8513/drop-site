# Decisions

## 2026-07-18 — Hosted legal pages are canonical; embedded SPA copies are retired

`https://trydropapp.com/privacy` and `https://trydropapp.com/terms` are the canonical Privacy Policy and Terms for the website, web app, and mobile app. The SPA must link to those documents instead of maintaining an embedded duplicate. The native app may render an aligned in-app copy for review accessibility, but its version/date and disclosures must match the hosted documents and it must expose the canonical links. The `.html` URLs remain compatibility redirects, not link targets.

## 2026-07-18 — One website, two views; "marketing page" framing retired

Founder: trydropapp.com is never to be referred to as a marketing page (or landing page). It is one website with a **signed-out view** (open browse-first discovery at trydropapp.com) and a **signed-in view** (the Prism SPA at `app.trydropapp.com` / `/app`). Docs, code comments, and test names use this framing. Same day, the "✦ The EDM show discovery app" hero badge was removed from both views' signed-out heroes.

## 2026-07-17 — Past-show records use shared canonical events

Manual and ticket-prefilled past shows write through the backend `record_past_show` RPC. The reusable event and lineup are shared; notes stay private. Date plus normalized title selects candidates, description disambiguates when available, and venue/city are confirmation context rather than identity. A differing lineup performs no write until the fan explicitly combines or keeps the shows separate. Unknown artist names remain moderated lineup suggestions. Existing catalog duplicates are not silently rewritten by this user flow; a future admin reconciliation must repoint all dependent records safely.

## 2026-07-08 — Website plus static browser account shell

trydropapp.com is the public browse-first website. Browser login/account access lives on `app.trydropapp.com`, served from this static website repo through the Cloudflare Worker.

The browser account shell uses Supabase Auth against the same Drop project as the native app and reads the same RLS-protected account data. It must not serve the Expo web app.
